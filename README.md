## Displays{#displays}
---
A Discord Display makes persistent information in Eco visible in Discord.  
It does this by regularly (once every ~60 seconds) fetching information from the Eco server and sending/editing a message in Discord to keep the Display up to date. Some events in Eco will also update displays related to those events.  

### Server info

Displays a single message that contains customizable information about the server such as name, connection info, online players, active laws and more.

### Player List

Displays a single message that contains the list of currently online players.

### Work Parties

Displays one message per work party, containing information about the status of that work party.

### Elections

Displays one message per election, containing information about the status of that election.  
Note that in the case of a non-boolean election, only the highest ranked option will be listed for each player in the votes.

### Currencies

Displays one message per existing currency up to a configurable limit and ordered by the amount of trades made in the currency during the current cycle.
For each currency, a configurable amount of users holding the highest amounts of the currency will be shown.
Can be configured to only show minted or credit currencies based on the existance of a minted currency.

## Inputs
---
An Input is a source of information in Eco or Discord that can be utilized in commands or other features.  
**Note**: The range for how far in the Discord message history Input messages can be found is limited.

### Snippets

Snippets are messages posted in Discord that can be reposted in Eco using the /Snippet command.  

Syntax for Snippets in Discord:  

> [Snippet] [&lt;SnippetName>]  
> &lt;Snippet text>
